A Python application serves as a communication bridge between users and CSV. Users can interact with the application by asking questions in natural language about the content of the loaded PDFs.

Here are some key features and processes of the CSV Reader Chat App:

Interaction with CSV File: The app can interact with CSV File and provide responses based on their content.

Natural Language Understanding: The app is designed to comprehend questions asked in natural language, making it user-friendly and accessible.

Utilization of Language Model: The CSV Reader Chat App uses a language model. This allows the app to understand and process the content of the CSV effectively.

Responsive and Relevant Answers: By comparing user queries with the text chunks and identifying the most similar ones, the application generates accurate and relevant responses.

Please note that the application's responses are only as good as the information loaded from the CSV, and it will only answer questions related to the content of the loaded CSV.
